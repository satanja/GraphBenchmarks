# Introduction

In this paper we will be looking at the construction, deletion, and traversal complexities of simple (or intuitive) graph data structures in the C++ standard library (STL). We first discuss all designed graphs and their worst case complexities for the above mentioned operations. We will then describe how these graphs perform in real time, followed by the results, which are interactive, and a discussion. We conclude with a brief summary and recommendation for typical "student" workloads.
